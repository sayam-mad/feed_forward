Here in this project I have used numpy as the only library to implement feed forward neural network using MNIST dataset , this will enable users in the University Courses learning Deep Learning as a module 
it is really simple and easy to understand and will clear your fundamental theoritical knowlege of the simplest neural network "Feed Forward".
